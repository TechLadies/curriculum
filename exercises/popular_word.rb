# Make a function that takes in a string, and returns the word that occured the most in that string.

# Hint: Use spilt to turn a string of characters into an array of words. 
# e.g. “gabe novi”.split(’ ')   #=>  [‘gabe’, ‘novi’]

# For example:
# most_popular_word("dog cat bird dog puppy dog snake cat")  should return "dog"

 
def function most_popular_word(str)
	#YOUR CODE
end


# Answer

# “gabe novi”.split(’ ')   #=>  [‘gabe’, ‘novi’]
# counts = {}

# if counts[word].nil?
#  # put word into counts hash with a value of 0
# else
#  # increment counts[word] by one
# end

# puts most_popular_word("dog cat bird dog puppy dog snake cat")

# after you have a counts hash filled with all the counts, find the word with the highest count value and return it
