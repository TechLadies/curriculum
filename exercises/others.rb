# Write a program that automatically converts English text to Morse code. example: to_morse(”gabe”)  #=> “- - *  * -  - * * *  *"

# Write a function that returns the requested fibonacci number. (example: fib(5) #=> 55    (the fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, and then each next number is the sum of the previous two. for example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, …)

# Write a function called every_second that takes in a list as its only argument and returns a list containing all the elements of even rank (i.e. every second element) from the input list.
# Example call:
# every_second([1, 2, 3, 4]) -> [2, 4]

# Write a function called sums that takes in a list of integers as its only argument and returns a list of two elements: the ﬁrst is the sum of all odd-ranked numbers in the input list, whereras the second element is the sum of all even-ranked elements in the input.
# Example call: sums([1 2 3 4 5]) -> [9 6]```

# Write a function that takes in an array of integers, and return the number of negative integers

# Fibonacci: Write a function that takes in an argument x, and returns the xth Fibonacci number
