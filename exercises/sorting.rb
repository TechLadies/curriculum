# The goal of this exercise is to write a sorting function
# by yourself, without using the default `.sort` method
# available in Ruby.
# First you should start by just trying to do it without any
# googling, just try to think how you would solve this on paper
# and then write in as a function.
# When you do it, you can try implemeting one of common sorting algorithms:
# merge sort, quick sort or selection sort
