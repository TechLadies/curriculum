# Mathematically, a set is collection of unique objects. In this exercise, you are given two sets of integers and expected to complete the following tasks:

# 1. Find the maximum value of two sets.
# E.g. max([5,1,2], [2,4,3]) -> 5

# 2. Find the union of two sets. The union of set A and B, denoted by A âˆª B, is a set of all things which are members of either A or B.
# E.g. union([1,2,5],[2,4,3]) -> [1,2,5,4,3]

# 3. Find the symmetric difference of two sets. The symmetric difference of set A and B is a set of all things that appear either in A or B, but not both.
# E.g. difference([2,1,5],[2,4,3]) -> [1,4,5,4]
