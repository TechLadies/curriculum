# The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.
#     1 
#    1 1
#   1 2 1
#  1 3 3 1 
# 1 4 6 4 1

# The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.
# Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal's triangle, i.e. the procedure should take two arguments, rowand column, and return the element for the speciÔ¨Åed column and row. Note that only one element must be returned and NOT the entire row. E.g. calling the method with row= 3 and column = 2should return 2. Likewise calling the method with row = 5and column = 3should return 6.
